This repository contains a collection of Verilog modules implementing various Cellular Automata (CA) rules and related processing for 1D and 2D grids. 
The provided modules include implementations of popular rules such as Rule 30, Rule 90, Rule 110, Rule 184, and a 16x16 grid implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Cellular Automata (CA) are discrete models studied in computer science and mathematics. They consist of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states. 
The state of each cell in the grid evolves over time according to a set of rules that depend on the states of neighboring cells. This repository implements various CA rules in Verilog,
which can be used for simulations or digital logic design.
